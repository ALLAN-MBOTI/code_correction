The AI-suggested version adds input validation, a reverse option, and uses .get() to avoid KeyError. It is more robust for real-world data where records may miss the requested key. The manual version is shorter and slightly faster for ideal inputs where all dictionaries contain the key and values are naturally comparable. In practice, the AI version is preferable for production due to fault-tolerance and clearer error messaging; the minor overhead is negligible compared to the gains in reliability. Development time is reduced by using AI completions because boilerplate and edge-cases are suggested immediately, but a human review is still necessary to ensure semantic correctness and performance characteristics.
