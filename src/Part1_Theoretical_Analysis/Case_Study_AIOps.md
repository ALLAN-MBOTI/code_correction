# AI in DevOps — AIOps Case Study Summary

AIOps combines machine learning and automation to improve DevOps operations. Two examples:

1. **Automated rollback and remediation** — ML models detect anomalous post-deploy metrics and trigger automated safe rollback policies, reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR).

2. **Predictive scaling and canary analysis** — Models forecast traffic and resource needs and can automatically promote or abort canary deployments based on learned success metrics.
