## Q1: How AI-driven code generation tools reduce development time (and limitations)

AI code tools (Copilot, Tabnine) reduce development time by generating boilerplate, suggesting completions, and surfacing API usage patterns. They speed prototyping and reduce repetitive typing. Limitations include context misunderstanding, potential insecure patterns, licensing concerns (training data provenance), and over-reliance by developers.

## Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning for Bug Detection

Supervised learning uses labeled data (buggy vs clean) and learns patterns tied to known bug types. It is effective for predicting recurring faults but requires labeled examples. Unsupervised learning detects anomalies and cluster-based deviations, useful for novel or unknown bug types but with higher false positives.

## Q3: Why bias mitigation is critical for UX personalization

Bias in personalization can systematically disadvantage groups by showing them fewer opportunities or subpar experiences. Mitigation preserves fairness, legal compliance, and user trust.
